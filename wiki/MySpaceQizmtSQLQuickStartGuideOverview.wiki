=Overview=

Qizmt SQL extends the functionality of Qizmt to include SQL operations which speed up the development process for application developers to write comprehensive business logic for large amounts of data in Qizmt clusters. With Qizmt alone, the developer is limited to the mapreduce paradigm and problems that fit into that paradigm. With the Qizmt SQL extension application developers may integrate other commonly useful tasks into their mapreduce pipelines such as massive deep graph processing; delta-only index, and index subset calculations and even distributed memory access from within map and reduce functions.

=Qizmt SQL Focus=

 * Massively distributed applications with easy development with SQL & C# mapreduce
 * Leverages the stability of Windows Servers, lower overall development costs then POSIX centric solutions
 * Leverages thousands of servers with virtually 0 development cost. For the most part, application developers can abstract the cluster as a single machine with many cores, disk space and memory
 * No special tools or skills required other then C# and SQL knowledgeâ€ƒ
