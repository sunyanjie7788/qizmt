Because the overhead time is fixed, large amounts of data can be streamed in and out via the _Qizmt ADO.NET Data Provider_ maximizing the bandwidth between data centers, but for small tasks like this, the overhead is not so negligible. This is because the SQL is translated to mapreduce and a number of network connections are made optimized to large-scale distributed data. While your job is running you can, however, view the progress of the underlying mapreducer jobs by discovering the jobID of the underlying mapreducer jobs `qizmt history –j` and attaching to the standard-out of a particular job with `qizmt –a viewjob <jobID>`
