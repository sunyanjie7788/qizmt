=`DELETE`=

{{{
DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <comparison> [[AND | OR] <...>];
}}}


Delete rows from a table under certain conditions. See SELECT WHERE for more information on the WHERE clause. This operation performs a full mapreduce on the table but only maps the tuples which match the WHERE clause. For ad-hoc deletes see the BULK UPDATE command.

===Examples===

{{{
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE ISLIKE â€˜%ferson';
}}}
