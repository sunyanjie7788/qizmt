==After adding more machines to my cluster the exchange phase is not speeding up.==
----

This is usually caused by adding more servers without adding more non-blocking IO. We recommend at least 1Gb/s of non blocking IO per machine in the cluster of 8-core machines and 2Gb/s non blocking IO per machine in a cluster of 16-core machines. Every machine in the cluster should be able to max out its network card’s bandwidth concurrently between all machines in the cluster.

==After adding more machines to my cluster the map phase is not speeding up.==
----

This is usualy the case when the data is so small that one or only a few cores have work to do and there is processing intensive computation being done in the mapper.

If during map, the qizmt perfmon cputime shows just one or a few cores are doing all the work, then it is likely that there aren’t enough parts in the input file for all cores to have to have work to do.

If during the reduce, the qizmt perfmon cputime shows that just one core is doing all the work, then it is likely that all the mapper output the same key.

One common workaround is to respread the data accross the cluster by simply passing it through a grouped-mapreducer job which keys on a random Int64. Then once the data is spread, run the job on the now spread data. The qizmt dir and qizmt info commands can be used to view the number and size of parts in MR.DFS files.
