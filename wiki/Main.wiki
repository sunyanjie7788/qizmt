MySpace Qizmt is a mapreduce framework for executing and developing distributed computation applications on large clusters of Windows servers. 

== Highly Scalable Applications of MySpace Qizmt ==
 * Data Mining 
 * Analytics 
 * Bulk Media Processing 
 * Content Indexing 

== Core MySpace Qizmt Features ==

 * Rapidly develop mapreducer jobs in C#.Net 
 * Easy Do-It-Yourself Installer 
 * Built-in IDE/Debugger 
  * Automatically colors heap allocations in red 
  * Autocomplete for rapid mapreducer development 
  * Step through and debug mapreducer jobs directly on target cluster 
 * From any machine in a cluster: 
  * Edit mapreducer jobs 
  * Debug mapreducer jobs 
  * Execute mapreducer jobs 
  * Administer mapreducer jobs 
 * Delta-only exchange option for Mapreduce jobs 
 * Configurable data-redundancy/machine level failover 
 * Easily add machines to a cluster to increase processing power and capacity 
 * CAC (Cluster Assembly Cache) for exposing .Net DLLs to mapreduce jobs 
 * Three kinds of jobs 
  * Mapreduce - Set-based logic on large amounts of data 
  * Remote - For problems that don't fit into the mapreducer mold 
  * Local - For orchestrating a pipeline of Mapreducer and Remote jobs 
 * Three ways to exhange data durring mapreduce 
  * Sorted - key/value pairs are evenly sorted accross the cluster 
  * Grouped - like key/value pairs make their way to same reducer but not sorted 
  * Hashsorted - super fast way to sort random data 

MySpace Qizmt currently supports .Net 3.5 SP1 on Windows 2003 Server, Windows 2008 Server and Windows Vista.
