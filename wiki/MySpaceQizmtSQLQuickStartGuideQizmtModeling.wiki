=Qizmt Modeling=

Often when applications developers are designing pipelines, it is helpful to draw up a design for the pipeline. In order to facilitate this we have settled on a simple modeling technique for this. These models are often hand-drawn or created with Microsoft Visio. Qizmt modeling is often used to:

 * Design new pipelines
 * Communicate design of pipelines already created
 * Help achieve capability maturity certifications

==Qizmt Modeling Syntax==

Applying logic both before and after the data is pivoted on a field in its tuples. (Note: arrows always point to data in this methodology) ||
|| <wiki:comment>Image:</wiki:comment><img src="http://qizmt.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/QSQL_ModelingSortedMR.png" alt="Modeling Sorted MR" /> || Like grouped mapreducer, but data is fully sorted instead of hashed on the keys such that each reducer gets an even range of sorted data. Often used to sort data into an index for RINDEX creation, however this may also be done with INSERT INTO SELECT which will translate to a sorted mapreducer execution. ||
